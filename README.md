# Personal git configuration

My global git config files and folders.

## Install
Use the `install` or `install.ps1` install script to link the configuration files to your home directory.

```sh
$ ./install
```

On Windows, run the script from an elevated powershell command prompt.

```powershell
> ./install.ps1
```
